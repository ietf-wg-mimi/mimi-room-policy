1.  Introduction

   The MIMI architecture [I-D.ietf-mimi-arch] describes how each room
   has an associated policy.  Providers offer a "policy envelope" of
   supported and allowed policy settings, from which the creator of a
   room selects a specific room policy.  The room policy might further
   allow individual participants to make specific choices (for example,
   allowing but not requiring read-message notifications), while
   constraining other choices (for example, prohibiting self-deleting
   messages).  Individual users can examine the room policy to determine
   if it is consistent with policies they accept either before or
   immediately on joining a room.  Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-mimi-arch]

   Making rooms interoperable across existing clients is challenging, as
   rooms and clients can support different policies and capabilities
   across vendors and providers.  Our goal is to balance the policy and
   authorization goals of the room with the policy and authorization
   goals of the end user, so we can support a broad range of vendors and
   providers.

   Each room is owned by one provider at a time.  The owning provider
   controls the range of acceptable policies.  The user responsible for
   the room can further choose among the acceptable policies.  Users
   (regardless if on other providers) can either accept the policies of
   the room or not.  However we want to make it as easy as possible for
   clients from other providers to comply with the room policy
   primitives without enumerating specific features or requiring all
   clients implementations to present an identical user experience.

   Configurable Role-based access control with permissions.  An example
   scheme is described in the Appendix.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Role: A long-lived position reflecting the privilege level of a
   participant in a room.  Possible values are owner, admin, regular-
   user, visitor, none, or outcast.  A role closely maps to the MUC
   concept of affiliation, not the MUC concept of role.

   Occupant: A user that has at least one client in the corresponding
   MLS group, and a role of owner, admin, regular-user, or visitor.

   Room ID: An identifier which uniquely identifies a room.

   User ID: An internal identifier which uniquely identifies a user.

   Nickname: The identifier by which a user is referred inside a room.
   Depending on the context it may be a display name, handle, pseudonym,
   or temporary identifier.  The nickname in one room need not correlate
   with the nickname for the same user in a different room.

   Client ID: An internal identifier which uniquely identifies one
   client/device instance of one user account.

   *Persistent vs. Temporary rooms*: A temporary room is destroyed when
   the last occupant exits whereas a persistent room is not destroyed
   when the last occupant exist.  As MLS has no notion of a group with
   no members, a persistent room could consist of a sequence of distinct
   MLS groups, zero or one of which would exist at a time.

2.1.  Moderation Terms

   Knock: To request entry into a room.

   Ban: To remove a user from a room such that the user is not allowed
   to re-enter the room (until and unless the ban has been removed).  A
   banned user has a role of "outcast".  Typically this action is only
   used in an open or semi-open room.  It is distinct than merely
   removing a user from an administered group.

   Kick: To temporarily remove a participant or visitor from a room.
   The user is allowed to re-enter the room at any time.

   Voice (noun): The privilege to send messages in a room.

   Revoke Voice: To remove the permission to send messages in a room.

   Grant Voice: To grant the permission to send messages in a room.

   Moderator: A client whose user has a role of admin or owner in the
   room.  A moderator can ban users, and (when allowed in the room) can
   grant and revoke voice, kick individual clients, and grant access
   (ex: in response to a knock).

3.  Room Capabilities

   Membership-Style: The overall approach of membership authorization in
   a room, which could be open, members-only (administrated), fixed-
   membership, or parent-dependent.

   Open room: An open room can be joined by any non-banned user.

   Members-Only room: A members-only room can only be joined by a user
   in the occupant list, or who is pre-authorized.  Authorized users can
   add or remove users to the room.  In an enterprise context, it is
   also common (but not required) for users from a particular domain,
   group, or workgroup to be pre-authorized to add themselves to a
   Members-Only room.

   Fixed-Membership room: Fixed-membership rooms have the list of
   occupants specified when they are created.  Other users cannot be
   added.  Occupants cannot leave or be removed, however a user can
   remove all its clients from the associated MLS group.  The most
   common case of a fixed-membership room is a 1:1 conversation.  This
   room membership style is used to implement Direct Message (DM) and
   Group DM features.  Only a single fixed-membership room can exist for
   any unique set of occupants.

   Parent-dependent room: In a parent-dependent room, the list occupants
   of the room must be a strict subset of the occupants of the parent
   room.  If a user leaves or is removed from the parent room, that user
   is automatically removed from any parent-dependent rooms of that
   parent.

   Multi-device vs. Single-device: A multi-device room can have multiple
   simultaneous clients of the same user as participants in the room.  A
   single-device room can have a maximum of one client per user in the
   room at any moment.

   Knock-Enabled vs. Knock-Disabled: In a knock-enabled room, non-banned
   users are allowed to programmatically request entry into the room.
   In a knock-disabled room this functionality is disabled.

   Moderated vs. Unmoderated: An an unmoderated room, any occupant can
   send messages to the room.  In a moderated room, only occupants who
   have "voice" can send messages to the room.

4.  Room policy format syntax

4.1.  Membership-related policy

   The membership_style of a room can be one of the following values:

   *  open

   *  members-only (default)

   *  fixed-membership

   *  parent-dependent

   enum {
     reserved(0)
     open(1),
     members-only(2),
     fixed-membership(3),
     parent-dependent(4),
     (255)
   } MembershipStyle;

   An open room allows any unbanned user.  A members-only room allows
   only invited or preauthorized users to join.  A fixed-membership room
   (which can be used for DMs or Group DMs) has a list of authorized
   users set at creation time that cannot be added to.  A parent-
   dependent room always has a strict subset of the participants of its
   parent room.

   If the membership_style is parent-dependent the parent_room_uri MUST
   be set with the room ID of the parent.  Otherwise the field is zero-
   length.

   If multi_device is true (the default), the MLS group may contain
   multiple clients per user.  If false only a single client can be an
   MLS member at one time.

   If knock_allowed is true, a non-participant can send a knock
   requesting access to the target room.  If false, a user cannot.  This
   option can only be enabled if the membership_style is members-only.
   The default is false.

   If moderated is true, the room supports granting and revoking voice.
   The default is false.

   enum {
     false(0),
     true(1)
   } bool;

   struct {
     MembershipStyle membership_style;
     Uri parent_room_uri<V>;
     bool multi_device;
     bool knock_allowed;
     bool moderated;
     bool persistent_room;
     bool password_protected;
     ...
   } RoomPolicy;

   If persistent_room is false, the room will be automatically deleted
   when the corresponding MLS group is destroyed (when there are no
   clients in the group).  If persistent_room is true, the room policy
   will remain and a client whose user has appropriate authorization can
   create a new MLS group for the same room.  (There is not a 1:1
   correlation of MLS group to room ID in a persistent room.)

   If password_protected is true, the room requires a passcode or
   passphrase when a client of a new user requests access to the
   GroupInfo used to join a group.  The default is false.

4.2.  Pre-authorized users

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     system(1),
     owner(2),
     admin(3),
     regular_user(4),
     visitor(5),
     banned(6),
     (255)
   } Role;

   struct {
     Role target_role;
     /* preauth_domain consists of ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens */
     opaque preauth_domain<V>;
     /* the remaining fields are in the form of a URI */
     opaque preauth_workgroup<V>;
     opaque preauth_group<V>;
     opaque preauth_user<V>;
   } PreAuthPerRoleList;

   struct {
     ...
     PreAuthPerRoleList pre_auth_list<V>;
     ...
   } RoomPolicy;

   In members-only rooms, it is convenient to pre-authorize specific
   users--or users from specific domains, workgroups/teams, and groups--
   to specific roles.  The workgroup, group, and user are expressed as a
   Uri. The domain is expressed in US-ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens
   only.  If the domain is internationalized, the Internationalized
   Domain Names [RFC5890] conversion MUST be done before filling in this
   value.

   Note that the system role is used to authorize external proposals for
   operations for other users.  For example, the system role can be used
   to authorize a provider to remove clients from groups when the
   corresponding user account is deleted.

4.3.  Delivery and Read notifications, Pseudonyms

   enum {
     optional(0),
     required(1),
     forbidden(2)
   } Optionality;

   struct {
     ...
     Optionality delivery_notifications;
     Optionality read_receipts;
     bool pseudonymous_ids;
     ...
   } RoomPolicy;

   The delivery_notifications value can be set to "forbidden",
   "optional", or "required".  If the value is set to "optional", the
   client uses its local configuration to determine if it should send
   delivery notifications in the group.

   The read_receipts value can be set to "forbidden", "optional", or
   "required".  If the value is set to "optional", the client uses its
   local configuration to determine if it should send read receipts in
   the group.

   The format for delivery notifications and read receipts is described
   in Section 5.12 of [I-D.ietf-mimi-content].

   If pseudonymous_ids is true, clients in the MLS group are free to use
   pseudonymous identifiers in their MLS credentials.  Otherwise the
   policy of the room is that "real" long-term identifiers are required
   in MLS credentials in the room's corresponding MLS group.

4.4.  Link, Logging, History, and Bot policies

   struct {
     bool on_request;
     Uri join_link;
     bool multiuser;
     uint32 expiration;
     Uri link_requests;
   } LinkPolicy;

   struct {
     Optionality logging;
     Uri logging_clients<V>;
     Uri machine_readable_policy;
     Uri human_readable_policy;
   } LoggingPolicy;

   struct {
     Optionality history_sharing;
     Role who_can_share<V>;
     bool automatically_share;
     uint32 max_time_period;
   } HistoryPolicy;

   struct {
     opaque name<V>;
     opaque description<V>;
     Uri homepage;
     Role bot_role;
     bool can_read;
     bool can_write;
     bool can_target_message_in_group;
     bool per_user_content;
   } Bot;

   struct {
     ...
     bool discoverable;
     LinkPolicy link_policy;
     LoggingPolicy logging_policy;
     HistoryPolicy history_sharing;
     Bot allowed_bots<V>;
     ...
   } RoomPolicy;

4.4.1.  Link policies

   If discoverable is true, the room is searchable.  Presumably this
   means the the only way to join the room in a client user interface is
   to be added by an administrator or to use a joining link.  Inside the
   LinkPolicy are several fields that describe the behavior of links.If
   the on_request field is true, no joining link will be provided in the
   room policy; the client will need to fetch a joining link out-of-band
   or generate a valid one for itself.  If present, the URI in
   link_requests can be used by the client to request an invite code.
   The value of join_link is empty and the other fields are ignored.If
   the on_request field is false, the join_link field will contain a
   joining link.  If the link will work for multiple users, multiuser is
   true.  The expiration field represents the time, in seconds after the
   start of the UNIX epoch (1-January-1970) when the link will expire.
   The link_requests field can be empty.

4.4.2.  Logging policies

   Inside the LoggingPolicy, the logging field can be forbidden,
   optional, or required.  If logging is forbidden then the other fields
   are empty.  If logging is required, the list of logging_clients needs
   to contain at least one logging URI.  Each provider should have no
   more than one logging client at a time in a room.  The
   machine_readable_policy and human_readable_policy fields optionally
   contain pointers to the owning provider's machine readable and human
   readable logging policies, respectively.  If logging is optional and
   there is at least one logging_client then logging is active for the
   room.

4.4.3.  Chat history policies

   Inside the HistoryPolicy, if history_sharing is forbidden, this means
   that clients (including bots) are expected to not to share chat
   history with new joiners, in which case who_can_share is empty,
   automatically_share is false, and max_time_period is zero.  Otherwise
   who_can_share is a list of roles that are authorized to share history
   (for example, only admins and owners can share).  The values of none
   and outcast cannot be used in who_can_share.  If automatically_share
   is true, clients can share history with new joiners without user
   initiation.  The history that is shared is limited to max_time_period
   seconds worth of history.

4.4.4.  Chat bot policies

   Inside the RoomPolicy there is a list of allowed_bots.  Each of which
   has several fields.  The name, description, and homepage are merely
   descriptive.  The bot_role indicates if the chat bot would be treated
   as a system-user, owner, admin, regular_user, or visitor.  The
   can_read and can_write fields indicate if the chat bot is allowed to
   read messages or send messages in the MLS group, respectively.  If
   can_target_message_in_group is true it indicates that the chat bot
   can send an MLS targeted message (see Section 2.2 of [I-D.ietf-mls-
   extensions]) or use a different conversation or out-of-band channel
   to send a message to specific individual users in the room.  If
   per_user_content is true, the chat bot is allowed to send messages
   with distinct content to each member.  (For example a poker bot could
   deal a different hand to each user in a chat).Users could set
   policies to reject or leave groups with bots rights that are
   inconsistent with the user's privacy goals.

4.5.  Extensibility of the policy format

   Finally, The extensibility mechanism allows for future addition of
   new room policies.

   enum {
     null(0),
     boolean(1),
     number(2),
     string(3),
     jsonObject(4)
   } ExtType;

   struct {
     opaque name<V>;
     ExtType type;
     opaque value<V>;
   } PolicyExtension;

   struct {
