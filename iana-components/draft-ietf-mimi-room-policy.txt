1.  Introduction

   The MIMI architecture [I-D.ietf-mimi-arch] describes how each room
   has an associated policy.  Providers offer a "policy envelope" of
   supported and allowed policy settings, from which the creator of a
   room selects a specific room policy.  The room policy might further
   allow individual participants to make specific choices (for example,
   allowing but not requiring read-message notifications), while
   constraining other choices (for example, prohibiting self-deleting
   messages).  Individual users can examine the room policy to determine
   if it is consistent with policies they accept either before or
   immediately on joining a room.  Section 4.4 of [I-D.ietf-mimi-arch]

   Making rooms interoperable across existing clients is challenging, as
   rooms and clients can support different policies and capabilities
   across vendors and providers.  Our goal is to balance the policy and
   authorization goals of the room with the policy and authorization
   goals of the end user, so we can support a broad range of vendors and
   providers.

   Each room is owned by one provider at a time.  The owning provider
   controls the range of acceptable policies.  The user responsible for
   the room can further choose among the acceptable policies.  Users
   (regardless if on other providers) can either accept the policies of
   the room or not.

   However we want to make it as easy as possible for clients from other
   providers to comply with the room policy primitives without
   enumerating specific features or requiring all clients
   implementations to present an identical user experience.  An
   important aspect of this is the system of configurable Role-based
   access control with granular capabilities per role (described in
   Section 3).  Each user in the participant list (defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol]) has exactly one role.  By virtue of a
   user's credential, a user might also be _preauthorized_ with a
   specific role as described in Section 4.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *Room ID*: An identifier which uniquely identifies a room.

   *User ID*: An internal identifier which uniquely identifies a user.

   *Nickname*: The identifier by which a user is referred inside a room.
   Depending on the context it may be a display name, handle, pseudonym,
   or temporary identifier.  The nickname in one room need not correlate
   with the nickname for the same user in a different room.

   *Client ID*: An internal identifier which uniquely identifies one
   client/device instance of one user account.

   *Persistent vs. Temporary rooms*: A temporary room is no longer
   joinable once the last participant exits whereas a persistent room is
   not destroyed when the last participant exist.  As MLS has no notion
   of a group with no members, a persistent room could consist of a
   sequence of distinct MLS groups, zero or one of which would exist at
   a time.

2.1.  Moderation Terms

   *Knock*: To request entry into a room.

   *Ban*: To remove a user from a room such that the user is not allowed
   to re-enter the room (until and unless the ban has been removed).  It
   is distinct from merely removing a user from a room.

   *Kick*: To temporarily remove a participant's clients from a room.
   The user is allowed to re-enter the room at any time.

   *Voice (noun)*: The privilege to send messages in a room.

   *Revoke Voice*: To remove the permission to send messages in a room.

   *Grant Voice*: To grant the permission to send messages in a room.

3.  Role-Based Access Control

   Most instant messaging systems have a concept of room membership
   being managed by a set of moderators or administrators, or
   collectively managed by existing members.  In some cases, rooms are
   completely open to new joiners unless they have been banned in some
   way.  In an enterprise context, it is also common (but not required)
   for users from a particular domain, group, or workgroup to be pre-
   authorized to add themselves to various types of rooms.  All these
   variations of room access are managed in MIMI using roles,
   capabilities (Section 8), and preauthorization (Section 4).

   The Role-Based Access Control component contains a list of all the
   roles in the room, and the capabilities associated with them.  It
   contains a role_index, which is used to refer to the role elsewhere.
   (Note that role indexes might not be contiguous.)  The role_index
   zero is reserved to refer to a participant that does not (yet) or no
   longer appears (or will no longer appear) in the participant list.

   The component also contains a role_name (a human-readable text string
   name for the role), and a role_description (another string, which can
   have zero length).

   Each Role also can contain constraints on the minimum and maximum
   number of participants, and the minimum and maximum number of active
   participants.  If the minimum number is zero, there is no minimum
   number of participants for that particular role.  If there is no
   maximum number of participants for a particular role, that parameter
   is absent.

      If the maximum number of active participants is zero, then no
      participants are allowed to have clients in the room's MLS group.

   The authorized_role_changes field is used to provide fine-grained
   control about which transitions are allowed when adding and removing
   participants and when moving participants to new roles, including
   banning/unbanning, and promoting/demoting to or from roles with
   moderator or administrator privileges.  A more detailed discussion is
   in the description of the specific capabilities in the next section.

      This design results in each participant only having a single role
      at a time, with a single list of capabilities and an explicit list
      of allowed role transitions.  It makes the authorization process
      for a verifier consistent regardless of the complexity of the set
      of authorization rules.

   Some examples are provided in Appendix A.

   RoleData is the format of the data field inside the ComponentData
   struct for the Role-Based Access Control component in the
   app_data_dictionary GroupContext extension defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions].

   /* See MIMI Capability Types IANA registry */
   uint16 CapabilityType;

   struct {
      uint32 from_role_index;
      uint32 target_role_indexes<V>;
   } SingleSourceRoleChangeTargets;

   struct {
     uint32 role_index;
     opaque role_name<V>;
     opaque role_description<V>;
     CapabilityType role_capabilities<V>;
     uint32 minimum_participants_constraint;
     optional uint32 maximum_participants_constraint;
     uint32 minimum_active_participants_constraint;
     optional uint32 maximum_active_participants_constraint;
     SingleSourceRoleChangeTargets authorized_role_changes<V>;
   } Role;

   struct {
     Role roles<V>;
   } RoleData;

   RoleData RoleUpdate;

   RoleUpdate (which has the same format as RoleData) is the format of
   the update field inside the AppDataUpdate struct in an AppDataUpdate
   Proposal for the Role-Based Access Control component.  If the
   contents of the update field are valid and if the proposer is
   authorized to generate such an update, the value of the update field
   completely replaces the value of the data field.

      Note that in the MIMI environment, changing the definitions of
      roles is anticipated to be very rare over the lifetime of a room
      (for example changing a room which has grown dramatically from
      cooperatively managed by all participants to explicitly moderated
      or administered).

   Changing Role definitions is sufficiently disruptive, that an update
   to this component is not valid if it appear in the same commit as any
   Participant List change.

4.  Preauthorized Users

   Preauthorized users are MIMI users and external senders that have
   authorization to adopt a role in a room by virtue of certain
   credential claims or properties, as opposed to being individually
   enumerated in the participant list.  For example, a room for employee
   benefits might be available to join with the regular participant role
   to all full-time employees with a residence in a specific country;
   while anyone working in the human resources department might be able
   to join the same room as a moderator.  This data structure is
   consulted in two situations: for external joins (external commits)
   and external proposals when the requester does not already appear in
   the participant list; and separately when an existing participant
   explicitly tries to change its _own_ role.

      Only consulting Preauthorized users in these cases prevents
      several attacks.  For example, it prevents an explicitly banned
      user from rejoining a group based on a preauthorization.

   PreAuthData is the format of the data field inside the ComponentData
   struct for the Preauthorized Participants component in the
   application_data GroupContext extension.

   The individual PreAuthRoleEntry rules in PreAuthData are consulted
   one at a time.  A PreAuthRoleEntry matches for a requester when every
   Claim.claim_id has a corresponding claim in the requester's MLS
   Credential which exactly matches the corresponding claim_value.  When
   the rules in a Preauthorized users struct match multiple roles, the
   requesting client receives the first role which matches its claims.

   struct {
     /* MLS Credential Type of the "claim"  */
     CredentialType credential_type;
     /* the binary representation of an X.509 OID, a JWT claim name  */
     /* string, or the CBOR map claim key in a CWT (an int or tstr)  */
     opaque id<V>;
   } ClaimId;

   struct {
     ClaimId claim_id;
     opaque claim_value<V>;
   } Claim;

   struct {
     /* when all claims in the claimset are satisfied, the claimset */
     */ is satisfied */
     Claim claimset<V>;
     Role target_role;
   } PreAuthRoleEntry;

   struct {
     PreAuthRoleEntry preauthorized_entries<V>;
   } PreAuthData;

   PreAuthData PreAuthUpdate;

   PreAuthUpdate (which has the same format as PreAuthData) is the
   format of the update field inside the AppDataUpdate struct in an
   AppDataUpdate Proposal for the Preauthorized Participants component.
   If the contents of the update field are valid and if the proposer is
   authorized to generate such an update, the value of the update field
   completely replaces the value of the data field.

      As with the definition of roles, in MIMI it is not expected that
      the definition of Preauthorized users would change frequently.
      Instead the claims in the underlying credentials would be modified
      without modifying the preauthorization policy.

   Changing Preauthorized user definitions is sufficiently disruptive,
   that an update to this component is not valid if it appears in the
   same commit as any Participant List change, except for user removals.

   Because the Preauthorized users component usually authorizes non-
   members, it is also a natural choice for providing concrete
   authorization for policy enforcing systems incorporated into or which
   run in coordination with the MIMI Hub provider or specific MLS
   Distribution Services.  For example, a preauthorized role could allow
   the Hub to remove participants and to ban them, but not to add any
   users or devices.  This unifies the authorization model for members
   and non-members.

5.  Base Room policy component syntax

   The following format is an MLS component which expresses top-level
   policy constraints, including global rules related to how membership
   is interpreted.  The rest of the rules about membership (the bulk)
   are expressed using roles Section 3, capabilities Section 8, and
   preauthorization Section 4.

   Rooms with fixed_membership set to true (fixed-membership rooms) have
   the list of participants specified when they are created.  While
   clients of existing participants can be added, other users cannot be
   added, so none of its non-zero, non-banned roles can contain the
   canAddParticipant capability.  Ordinary users cannot leave or be
   removed, however a user can remove all its clients from the
   associated MLS group.  The most common case of a fixed-membership
   room is a 1:1 conversation.  This room membership style is used to
   implement Direct Message (DM) and Group DM features.  Only a single
   fixed-membership room can exist for any unique set of participants.

   In rooms with parent_dependent set to true (a parent-dependent room),
   the list of participants of the room MUST be a strict subset of the
   participants of the parent room.  If a user leaves or is removed from
   the parent room, that user is automatically removed from any parent-
   dependent rooms of that parent.  A parent-dependent room is always
   hosted on the same Hub as the parent room.

   If parent-dependent is true, the parent_room MUST be set with the
   room ID of the parent.  Otherwise the field is zero-length.

      Note: A room can be both fixed_membership and parent_dependent,
      for example, for room used for a multi-media call of clients in a
      Group DM.

   If multi_device is true (the default), the MLS group may contain
   multiple clients per user.  If false only a single client can be an
   MLS member at one time.

   When max_clients has a value, the room's associated MLS group MUST
   NOT have more clients than the provided value.  Likewise when
   max_users has a value, the room MUST NOT have more non-banned entries
   in the participant list than that value.

   enum {
     false(0),
     true(1)
   } bool;

   struct {
       bool fixed_membership;
       bool parent_dependant;
       Uri parent_room<V>;
       bool multi_device;
       optional uint32 max_clients;
       optional uint32 max_users;
       bool pseudonyms_allowed;
       bool persistent_room;
       bool discoverable;
       Component policy_components<V>;
   } BaseRoomPolicy;

   BaseRoomPolicy BaseRoomData;
   BaseRoomPolicy BaseRoomUpdate;

   If pseudonyms_allowed is true, clients in the MLS group are free to
   use pseudonymous identifiers in their MLS credentials.  Otherwise the
   policy of the room is that "real" long-term identifiers are required
   in MLS credentials in the room's corresponding MLS group.

   If persistent_room is false, the room will be automatically
   inaccsessible when the corresponding MLS group is destroyed (when
   there are no clients in the group).  If persistent_room is true, the
   room policy will remain and a client whose user has appropriate
   authorization can create a new MLS group for the same room.

   If discoverable is true, the room is searchable in some way.
   Presumably this means that if discoverable is false, the only way to
   join the room in a client user interface is to be added by an
   administrator or to use a joining link.

   Finally, the other policy components that are relevant to this room
   are listed in the policy_components vector, including the roles_list
   and preauth_list components (if present).

6.  Other MIMI policy components

6.1.  Status Notifications component

   Delivery and Read notifications are a very popular feature of instant
   messaging systems, but also can leak private information such as the
   online status of participants.  Such status notifications can also
   consume a large amount of resources, especially in large rooms.

   enum {
     optional(0),
     required(1),
     forbidden(2)
   } Optionality;

   struct {
     Optionality delivery_notifications;
     Optionality read_receipts;
   } StatusNotificationPolicy;

   StatusNotificationPolicy StatusNotificationPolicyData;
   StatusNotificationPolicy StatusNotificationPolicyUpdate;

   The delivery_notifications value can be set to "forbidden",
   "optional", or "required".  If the value is set to "optional", the
   client uses its local configuration to determine if it should send
   delivery notifications in the room.

   The read_receipts value can be set to "forbidden", "optional", or
   "required".  If the value is set to "optional", the client uses its
   local configuration to determine if it should send read receipts in
   the room.

   The format for delivery notifications and read receipts is described
   in [I-D.mahy-mimi-message-status].

6.2.  Join Link policies component

   Inside the LinkPolicy are several fields that describe the behavior
   of join links.  If the on_request field is true, no joining link will
   be provided in the room policy; the client will need to fetch a
   joining link out-of-band or generate a valid one for itself.  If
   present, the URI in link_requests can be used by the client to
   request an invite code.  The value of join_link is empty and the
   other fields are ignored.

   If the on_request field is false, the join_link field will contain a
   joining link.  If the link will work for multiple users, multiuser is
   true.  The expiration field represents the time, in seconds after the
   start of the UNIX epoch (1-January-1970) when the link will expire.
   The link_requests field can be empty.

   struct {
     bool on_request;
     Uri join_link;
     bool multiuser;
     uint32 expiration;
     Uri link_requests;
   } JoinLinkPolicy;

   JoinLinkPolicy JoinLinkPolicyData;
   JoinLinkPolicy JoinLinkPolicyUpdate;

6.3.  Link Preview policy component

   TBC

6.4.  Asset policies component

   Assets refer to attached files, images, audio files, and video files.

   TBC

   enum {
     direct(0),
     hubProxy(1),
     ohttp(2),
     (255)
   } DownloadPrivacyType;

   enum {
     unspecified(0),
     localProvider(1),
     hub(2),
     (255)
   } AssetUploadLocation;

   struct {
     DownloadPrivacyType allowed_download_types<V>;
     DownloadPrivacyType forbidden_download_types<V>;
     DownloadPrivacyType default_download_type;
   } DownloadPrivacy;

   struct {
     AssetUploadLocation asset_upload_location;
     opaque upload_domain<V>;
     DownloadPrivacy download_privacy;
     uint64 max_image;
     uint64 max_audio;
     uint64 max_video;
     uint64 max_attachment;
   } AssetPolicy;

   AssetPolicy AssetPolicyData;
   AssetPolicy AssetPolicyUpdate;

6.5.  Logging policy component

   Some messaging systems (for example in the health care or financial
   services sectors) often require mandatory logging of calls and
   messages.  The goal of these policies is to make detection of such
   policies automatic, to allow clients to make appropriate local policy
   decisions when such policies exist.

   Inside the LoggingPolicy, the logging field can be forbidden,
   optional, or required.  If logging is forbidden then the other fields
   are empty.  If logging is required, the list of logging_clients needs
   to contain at least one logging URI.  Each provider should have no
   more than one logging client at a time in a room.  The
   machine_readable_policy and human_readable_policy fields optionally
   contain pointers to the owning provider's machine readable and human
   readable logging policies, respectively.  If logging is optional and
   there is at least one logging_client then logging is active for the
   room.

   struct {
     Optionality logging;
     Uri logging_clients<V>;
     Uri machine_readable_policy;
     Uri human_readable_policy;
   } LoggingPolicy;

   LoggingPolicy LoggingPolicyData;
   LoggingPolicy LoggingPolicyUpdate;

6.6.  Chat history policy component

   One of the most requested features of instant messaging systems is
   that new joiners can view some or all of the message history before
   joining.  While useful, it has serious implications to the privacy of
   existing members, and substantially weakens forward secrecy (FS) (See
   Section 8.2.2 of [RFC9750]).

   Inside the HistoryPolicy, if history_sharing is forbidden, this means
   that clients (including bots) are expected to not to share chat
   history with new joiners, in which case roles_that_can_share is
   empty, automatically_share is false, and max_time_period is zero.
   Otherwise roles_that_can_share is a list of roles that are authorized
   to share history (for example, only admins and owners can share).
   The role index zero (non-participant) and one (banned) cannot be used
   in the who_can_share list, nor can any role where
   max_active_participants is zero.  If automatically_share is true,
   clients can share history with new joiners without user initiation.
   The history that is shared is limited to max_time_period seconds
   worth of history.

   struct {
     Optionality history_sharing;
     uint32 roles_that_can_share<V>;
     bool automatically_share;
     uint32 max_time_period;
   } HistoryPolicy;

   HistoryPolicy HistoryPolicyData;
   HistoryPolicy HistoryPolicyUpdate;

6.7.  Chat bot policy component

   There are several types of chat bot in instant messaging systems,
   some of which only interact with

   Inside the BotPolicy there is a list of allowed_bots, each of which
   has several fields.  The name, description, and homepage are merely
   descriptive.  The bot_role_index indicates the role index in that the
   bot operates, which controls the capbilities of the bot.

   If can_target_message_in_group is true it indicates that the chat bot
   can send an MLS targeted message (see Section 2.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions]) or use a different conversation or out-of-
   band channel to send a message to specific individual users in the
   room.

   If per_user_content is true, the chat bot is allowed to send messages
   with distinct content to each member.  (For example a poker bot could
   deal a different hand to each user in a chat).

   Users could set policies to reject or leave groups with bots rights
   that are inconsistent with the user's privacy goals.

6.8.  Message expiration policy component

   Many instant messaging systems have an automatically expiring
   messages feature.

   If expiring messages are required, optional, or forbidden is
   controlled by the expiring_messages field.

   When expiring_messages are required or optional, the
   min_expiration_duration indicates the shortest acceptable expiration
   duration in seconds.  The max_expiration_duration indicates the
   longest acceptable duration in seconds.  The
   default_expiration_duration optionally indicates a preferred duration
   in seconds.

   When expiring_messages is forbidden, both the min_expiration_duration
   and the max_expiration_duration are set to zero, and the
   default_expiration_duration is not present.

   struct {
     Optionality expiring_messages;
     uint32 min_expiration_duration;
     uint32 max_expiration_duration;
     optional uint32 default_expiration_duration;
   } MessageExpiration;

   MessageExpiration MessageExpirationData;
   MessageExpiration MessageExpirationUpdate;

7.  Operational policy component

   Section 7 of the [RFC9750] defines a set of operational policy
   considerations that influence interoperability of MLS clients.  MIMI
   explicitly address a handful of the issues in the document by taking
   a position on ordering (Proposals referenced in a Commit need to be
   received before the Commit; the Commit entering a new epoch needs to
   be received before any other messages in that epoch), privacy of
   handshake messages (handshakes can be a PublicMessage or
   SemiPrivateMessage), and GroupInfo storage (committers need to
   provide a valid GroupInfo to the Hub).  The rest of these issues are
   described here.  Just because a topic is listed does not mean that a
   room needs to take a position; nor different rooms on a Hub need to
   have different policies for these items.

7.1.  Some MLS-related policy that could be tied to a room

   *  any mandatory or forbidden MLS extensions.

   *  which proposals are valid to have in a commit, including but not
      limited to:

      -  when, and under what circumstances, a reinitialization proposal
         is allowed.

      -  when proposals from external senders are allowed and how to
         authorize those proposals.

      -  when external joiners are allowed and how to authorize those
         external commits.

      -  which other proposal types are allowed.

   *  when members should commit pending proposals in a group.

   *  when two credentials represent the same client.

   *  how long to allow a member to stay in a group without updating its
      leaf keys before removing them.

   *  When and how to pad messages.

   *  When to send a reinitialization proposal.

   *  How often clients should update their leaf keys.

   *  Whether to prefer sending full commits or partial/empty commits.

   *  Whether there should be a required_capabilities extension in
      groups.

   *  minimum and maximum lifetime of KeyPackages

   *  if last resort KeyPackages are allowed

   *  how long to store resumption PSK (how much time and how many
      epochs)

   *  minimum and maximum number past epochs to keep

   *  how long to keep unused nonce and key pairs for a sender

   *  maximum number of unused key pairs to keep

   *  maximum number of steps that clients will move a secret tree
      ratchet forward in response to a single message before rejecting
      it

   *  tolerance to out of order app messages

   *  tolerance to out of order handshake messages

   *  handshakes may be which of PublicMessage, PrivateMessage, or
      SemiPrivateMessage.

   *  if external joiners are allowed

   *  if external proposals are allowed

      -  if so, who can submit

      -  which member(s) are responsible for submitting pending
         proposals

   *  how a joiner gets access to the ratchet_tree

   The structure below describes provides a way to describe many of
   these parameters.

   OperationalParameters OperationalParametersUpdate;

7.2.  Not relevant to MIMI (between client and its provider)

   *  how many KPs to keep active

   *  how group IDs are constructed

7.3.  Areas for future works

   How to protect and share the GroupInfo objects needed for external
   joins.

   If an application wishes to detect and possibly discipline members
   that send malformed commits with the intention of corrupting a
   group's state, there must be a method for reporting and validating
   malformed commits.

   MLS requires the following parameters to be defined, which must be
   the same for two implementations to interoperate:

   Application-level identifiers of public key material (specifically
   the application_id extension as defined in Section 5.3.3 of
   [RFC9420]).

8.  Role Capabilities

   As described in Section 3, each role has a list of capabilities,
   which in rare cases could be empty.  When we say that the holder of a
   capability can take some action, we mean that whatever entity is
   taking the action (a participant, a potential future participant, or
   an external party) has a specific entry in the Participant List
   struct and a corresponding role--or is preauthorized to take action
   with a specific role via the Preauthorized Users struct--and that the
   role_capabilities list contains the relevant capability.

   Unless otherwise specified, capabilities apply both to sending a set
   of consistent MLS proposals that could be committed by any member of
   the corresponding MLS group, and to sending an MLS commit containing
   a set of consistent MLS proposals.

8.1.  Membership Capabilities

   The membership capabilities below allow authorized holders to update
   the Participant list, or change the active participants (by removing
   and adding MLS clients corresponding to those participants), or both.

   *  canAddParticipant - the holder of this capability can add another
      user, that is not already in the participant list, to the
      participant list.  (This capability does not apply to the holder
      adding itself.)  The authorized_role_changes list in the holder's
      role is consulted to authorize the added user's target role.  The
      authorized_role_changes list MUST have an entry where the
      authorized_role_changes.from_role_index equals zero, and that
      entry's target_role_indexes list includes the target role.  The
      proposed action is only authorized if the action respects both the
      maximum_participants_constraint (if present) and
      maximum_active_participants_constraint (if present) for the added
      user's target role.  When the participant list addition for the
      target role is authorized, the holder is also authorized to add
      any MLS clients matching the added user to the room's MLS group .

   *  canAddOwnClient - a holder of this capability that is in the
      participant list, can add its own client (via an external commit
      or external proposal); and can add other clients that share the
      same user identity (via Add proposals) if the holder's client is
      already a member of the corresponding MLS group.

   *  canAddSelf - the holder of this capability can use an external
      commit or external proposal to add itself to the participant list.
      (The holder MUST NOT already appear in the participant list).  Its
      usage differs slightly based on in which role it appears.

      -  When canAddSelf appears on role zero, any user who is not
         already in the participant list can add itself, with certain
         provisions.  The holder consults the authorized_role_changes
         list for an entry with from_role_index equal to zero.  The
         holder can add itself with any non-zero target_role_indexes
         from that entry, if the action respects both the
         maximum_participants_constraint (if present) and
         maximum_active_participants_constraint (if present) for the
         added user's target role.

      -  When canAddSelf appears on a non-zero role, a client can only
         become the holder of this capability via the Preauthorized
         users mechanism.  The authorized_role_changes list in the
         target role MUST have an entry where the from_role_index is
         zero and the target_role_indexes contains the target role.  In
         addition, the action MUST respect both the
         maximum_participants_constraint (if present) and
         maximum_active_participants_constraint (if present) for the
         added user's target role.

   *  canUseJoinCode - the holder of this capability can externally join
      a room using a join code for that room, provided the join code is
      valid, the join code refers to a valid target role, and both the
      maximum_participants_constraint (if present) and
      maximum_active_participants_constraint (if present) constraints
      are respected.

   *  canRemoveParticipant - the holder of this capability can propose
      a) the removal of another user (excluding itself) from the
      participant list, and b) removal of all of that user's clients, as
      a single action.  There MUST NOT be any clients of the removed
      user in the MLS group after the corresponding commit.  A proposer
      holding this capability consults its role's
      authorized_role_changes entries for an entry where from_role_index
      matches the target user's current role; if the target_role_indexes
      for that entry contains zero, and the
      minimum_participants_constraint and
      minimum_active_participants_constraint are satisfied, the proposal
      is authorized.

   *  canRemoveOwnClient - the holder of this capability can propose to
      remove its own client using an MLS Remove or SelfRemove proposal
      without changing the Participant list.  Due to restrictions in MLS
      which insure the consistency of the group, this action cannot be
      committed by the leaving user.  If the
      minimum_active_participants_constraint is satisfied, the proposal
      is authorized.

   *  canRemoveSelf - the holder of this capability can propose to
      remove itself from (i.e. leave) the participant list; it MUST
      simultaneously propose to remove all of its remaining clients from
      the corresponding MLS group.  Due to restrictions in MLS which
      insure the consistency of the group, this action cannot be
      committed by the leaving user.  A proposer holding this capability
      consults its role's authorized_role_changes entries for an entry
      where from_role_index matches its current role; if the
      target_role_indexes for that entry contains zero, and the
      minimum_participants_constraint and
      minimum_active_participants_constraint are satisfied, the proposal
      is authorized.

   *  canKick - the holder of this capability can propose removal of
      another participant's clients, without changing the Participant
      List.  If the minimum_active_participants_constraint is satisfied,
      the proposal is authorized.

   *  canChangeUserRole - the holder of this capability is authorized to
      change the role of another participant (but not itself), according
      to the holder's authorized_role_changes list, from a role
      represented by an entry where the target's current role matches
      from_role_index to any of the non-zero target_role_indexes in the
      same element of authorized_role_changes.  The
      minimum_participants_constraint and
      minimum_active_participants_constraint for the target user's
      current role, and the maximum_participants_constraint (if present)
      and maximum_active_participants_constraint (if present) for the
      target user's target role must also be satisfied.

   *  canChangeOwnRole - the holder of this capability is authorized to
      change its own role to the first non-zero role it matches in the
      Preauthorized users component (see Section 4).  The
      authorized_role_changes list is _not_ consulted.  The
      minimum_participants_constraint and
      minimum_active_participants_constraint for the holder's original
      role, and the maximum_participants_constraint (if present) and
      maximum_active_participants_constraint (if present) for the
      holder's target role must also be satisfied.

   *  canBan - the holder of this capability can propose to "ban"
      another user.  Specifically, a successful ban changes the target
      user's role to a special "banned" role (if it exists), and removes
      all the banned user's clients.  The "banned" role always has
      role_index = 1 and role_name = "banned" (without quotes).

         A "banned" role does not have to exist in a room, but to use
         the canBan and canUnban capabilities, the role needs to exist
         exactly as described above.  While holding canChangeUserRole
         and canKick capabilities would allow the same action, it could
         potentially allow the holder other actions which might be
         undesirable in some contexts, such as kicking clients without
         banning.

      A proposer holding this capability consults its role's
      authorized_role_changes entries for an entry where from_role_index
      matches the target user's current role; if the target_role_indexes
      for that entry contains the role_index 1; that role_name =
      "banned" for the role with role_index = 1, and the
      minimum_participants_constraint and
      minimum_active_participants_constraint are satisfied, the proposal
      is authorized.

   *  canUnban - the holder of this capability can propose to "unban"
      another user.  Specifically, a successful unban changes the target
      user's role from role_index = 1 to another non-zero role_index
      allowed by the holder's authorized_role_changes list.  Adding
      clients for that unbanned user is _not_ authorized by this
      capability.  The authorization of this capability is identical to
      the canChangeUserRole capability, except that the from_role_index
      for the unbanned user MUST be 1, and the role_name of role 1 MUST
      be "banned".

8.2.  Adjust metadata

   The holder of each of the following capabilities is authorized to
   update the Room metadata defined in [I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol],
   changing the relevant field:

   *  canChangeRoomName

   *  canChangeRoomDescription

   *  canChangeRoomAvatar

   *  canChangeRoomSubject

   *  canChangeRoomMood

8.3.  Message Capabilities

   The capabilities below refer to functionality related to the instant
   messages, for example sent using the MIMI content format
   [I-D.ietf-mimi-content].

   *  canEditReaction - the holder can replace its own previous reaction
      with another reaction

   *  canDeleteOwnReaction - the holder can retract (unlike) its own
      previous reaction.

   *  canDeleteOtherReaction - the holder can delete the reaction of
      another user's previous reaction

   *  canEditOwnMessage - the holder can edit the content of one of its
      own previously sent messages

   *  canDeleteOwnMessage - the holder can retract one of its own

   other capabilities in this section can only be enforced by other
   clients.

8.4.  Asset Capabilities

   *  canUploadAttachment - the holder can upload a file with the
      "attachent" disposition.

   *  canDownloadAttachment - the holder can download a file with the

   Capabilities" registry.  The registry should be under the heading of
   "More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI)".  Assignments to
   this registry in the range 0x0000 to 0xF000 are via Specification
   Required policy [RFC8126] using the MIMI Designated Experts.
   Assignments in the range 0xF000 to 0xFFFF are for private use.

   Template:

   *  Value: The numeric value of the role capability

   *  Name: The name of the role capability

   *  Reference: The document where this role capability is defined

   their org user role, their org admin role, the no_role; and can ban
   (but not unban) their own org users.  The non-host orgs do not have
   the canChangeOwnRole and canAddSelf, and are limited to 3 admins per
